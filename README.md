- 👋 Hi, We're @altheacyberservices
- 👀 We're a very (very!) small company based in Germany, centered in cybersecurity.
- 💞️ We look to collaborate with the global cybersecurity collective, "doing something about that".  Aside providing support from of our (very small number) of clients,  we do a lot of pro bono work because a lot of people  suffers due the attacks of cyberdelinquents and, sadly, cyberforensics are expensive and not all people can afford that. 
- 👋 Thanks for your interest on us!
